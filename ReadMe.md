# Final Project

## Goal

I want to learn how to make agents utilizing Langchain, while messing with docling. I will attempt to make this into a neat little CLI tool. 

Essentially making a simple agent anyone with a few free api keys can use, modify and mess around with. A plus would be if I can actually make it usefull.

Goals:

- Utilize MCP
- Utilize Docling
- Create an interesting you find useful
- Make the CLI interesting to look at.(looks like stuff is happening when actions are being taken just to alert you the agent is doing things.)
- Model configuration 
- Structured output 
- Conversational memory 
- keep it simple and functional(hopefully)
